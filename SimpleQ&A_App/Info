create a simple Q&A system using a pre-trained model and how to deploy it as a web API using Flask.

For deployment, you can use platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Azure. Here's a basic guide for deploying on Heroku:

Sign up for a Heroku account.
Install the Heroku CLI.
Create a requirements.txt file listing the dependencies (torch, transformers, flask).
Create a Procfile with the following content:

@Bash
web: python api.py

>"commit your code to version control system like GIT"

heroku create your-app-name

>"Create a new heroku app"

git push heroku master

>"Deploy and open your app"

heroku open


@This is a simplified example for a production level system.
> consider security, scalability and performance optimizations
