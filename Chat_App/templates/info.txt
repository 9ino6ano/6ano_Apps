Visit http://localhost:5000 in your web browser, and you should see a simple chat interface.
Type a message, and the chatbot will respond.

This example uses the ChatterBot library, which is a simple conversational agent training tool.
For a more sophisticated chatbot, you might consider using more advanced natural language processing libraries like spaCy or transformers such as Hugging Face's Transformers.
Additionally, you may want to deploy your application on a more robust server for production use.
